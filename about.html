    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>Predict the Sky was started at the first <a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/">
       Space Apps Challenge</a>, hosted at the <a href="http://metoffice.gov.uk">Met
       Office</a> back in 2012. The idea was to merge weather prediction data with 
       the tracking of space objects so that you'd know how much of a chance you'd 
       actually have to see something.</p>

    <p>Since then, it's been worked on at several subsequent hack days, notably the
       2013 <a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/">Space Apps Challenge</a> where 
       this site was started and the API came centre-focus. The intention is to
       publish an API for space objects and weather predictions for other people to
       build upon.</p>
